	<h1> Volleyball Stat Tracker</h1>
	<h3>Jonathan Witten and TJ Andrews</h3>
	<a href = "mockup.html">Project Concept</a>
	<p>Our project will provide an easy interface for Volleyball coaches 
	and managers to track their players' statistics during a game. The 
	main interface of this application will be a representation of players
	where the user will be able to record specific volleyball stats such as
	kills, aces, digs, assists, errors, etc. Coaches will be able to manage
	an account where they can view statistics across the duration of a
	season. We will use a backend MySql database to hold the rosters,
	players, and statistics for each team. The frontend will be a javascript
	view that allows the user to visualize a volleyball court and manage
	rotations and lineups while recording stats. The front end will make 		AJAX calls to a PHP server side where data in game will be processed
	and stored in the database.
